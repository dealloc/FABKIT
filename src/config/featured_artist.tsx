				<p className="text-primary/80 dark:text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
					In this showcase we are highlighting MalZenith who won the Flesh and
					Blood discord's custom card contest with his Armory Deck for Verdance.
					it features seven carefully designed custom cards that explore an
					alternate build path focused on making Verdance feel more "wizard-y",
					whilst also utilizing underplayed cards from her Rosetta suite.
					<br />
					<br />
					The centerpiece of this design is <strong>Sigil of Lifecycles</strong>
					, a Majestic Earth Wizard Action that functions as Verdance's version
					of Blazing Aether or Freezing Point. Unlike those straightforward
					damage dealers, this Sigil requires clever sequencing to unlock its
					potential since it deals no inherent damage when triggered by itself.
					There are three paths to breaking this card: instant-speed lifegain
					combos, start-of-turn lifegain triggers, or creative ways to remove
					the Sigil from play at unexpected moments. This creates puzzle-like
					gameplay where small, consistent combos chip away at opponents rather
					than delivering explosive knockouts.
					<br />
					<br />
					<strong>Seeds of Potential</strong> offers a new Earth Action that
					enables Decompose without attacking, creating embodiments of earth
					tokens.
					<strong>Enchanted Reflection</strong> brings dangerous versatility by
					copying action auras from the graveyard with cost reduction, and a
					potential go again, carefully balanced to prevent abuse while opening
					possibilities for creative Sigil chains.
					<br />
					<br />
					Also note the equipment suite. <strong>Dreaming Beauty</strong> is a
					zero-armor Blade Break headpiece enabling infinite Sigil of Fyendal
					loops at the cost of extreme vulnerability.
					<strong>Faerie Court Tunic</strong> builds energy counters through
					lifegain, offering multi-turn planning opportunities as an alternative
					to standard Tunic.
					<strong>Inked Etchings</strong> provides minimal defense but crucial
					Sigil timing manipulation, delaying or protecting key pieces for
					optimal combo execution.
					<strong>Sugarplum Dance</strong> reimagines Storm Striders, enabling
					surprise damage through early Sigil activation while maintaining
					deliberate weaknesses to counter-strategies.
					<br />
					<br />
					Each card includes intentional limitations preventing power creep
					while expanding Verdance's toolkit meaningfully. The deck rewards
					careful resource management, precise timing, and deep understanding of
					lifegain trigger interactions. Rather than simply making Verdance
					stronger, this design creates an entirely different playstyle that
					emphasizes incremental value and defensive positioning over
					traditional aggressive strategies.
